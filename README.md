# Churn-Modelling-on-Credit-Card-Customer-Data

The aim of this project was to predict customer churn based on a bank dataset with 10,000 unique records.
The dataset was pulled from Kaggle and can be found via this link: https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers

The project hoped to achieve high predictive performance, in particular - recall score, hence a chosen F2-score was used when evaluating the models.
Under the champion model which falls under the LGBM modelling, Locally Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) was experimented with as well to gain
more granular understanding of the features that were influencing predicted instances.

I embarked on a predictive modelling project to train my python skills as well as my understanding of ML.

Any feedback would be appreciated, thanks.
